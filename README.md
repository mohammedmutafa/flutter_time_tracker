This is created as a Flutter Web project, so you can play around with the design and help me find bugs.<br>

As I can't have the conversation audio, I used instrumental music for each task.<br>
Initially I went on with grabbing the audio duration at runtime but the audio size may vary and unneccessary computation is required. So instead, I went on with static time having calculating the audio duration at server side in mind.<br>

You can support me by buying me a coffee.
